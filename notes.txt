1. var is used to define variables and can be changed  :
    var a= string,integer ,will be direct
    var a string, it used when user need to give value later
    a:=string/interger, is a shorthand method and this is only used inside the func while others can be assigned outside of func
2. data types:
    - Basic Data Types:
        Integers:
            Signed integers (int, int8, int16, int32, int64) → Store positive and negative whole numbers.
            Unsigned integers (uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uintptr) → Store only non-negative whole numbers.
        Floating Point Numbers:
            float32 → Stores decimal numbers with single precision.
            float64 → Stores decimal numbers with double precision.
        Complex Numbers:
            complex64 → Stores complex numbers using float32 parts.
            complex128 → Stores complex numbers using float64 parts.
        Byte:
            byte → Alias of uint8, used for raw binary data.
        Rune:
            rune → Alias of int32, represents a Unicode character.
        String:
            string → Stores immutable UTF-8 encoded text.
        Boolean:
            bool → Stores true or false.

    - Composite Data Types
        Non-Reference Types:
            Arrays → Fixed-size collection of elements.
            Structs → Group different data types together.
        Reference Types:
            Slices → Dynamic view of an array.
            Maps → Key–value data structure.
            Channels → Used for goroutine communication.
        Interface:
            Interface → Defines behavior using method signatures.

3. Const used when a variable does not need to be changed after it is declared.
     same method as var is defined but does not have shorthand method

4. For is the only construct in go for looping:
     -range, used to iterate over collections (arrays, slices, maps, strings, channels)
     -break, is used to exit the loop at a specific point in the loop.
     -continue, is used to skip a specific part of the loop.
5. if , we can also declare a variable inside if constructor.
6. else if,
7. else,
8. Or operation we use ||
9. And operation we use &&
10. for equal to operation we use ==
11. switch :
     -case
     -defualt
12. interface, is used to give any type of datatype in go
13. .type, is used to find type of the give value.
14. array or map  always have default value when array or map is of int->0, str->"", Bool->False
15. array is a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
     it must be used when you know the length of the array
     also len of array must be declared a first of the array.
16. Slice in Go is a dynamic, flexible view of an array. Unlike arrays, slices don’t have a fixed size.
       -make,is a built-in function used to initialize and allocate memory for three specific built-in types: slices, maps, and channels.
       -cap,is a built-in function that returns the capacity of a container
       -len,The number of elements the window currently shows.
       -append,is a built-in function used to add one or more elements to the end of a slice.
       -copy, is a built-in function used to copy elements from one slice into another
       -.Equal(s1, s2): Returns true if two slices have the same elements in the same order.
       -.Contains(s, val): Checks if a specific value exists in the slice.
       -.Index(s, val): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a value, or -1 if not found.
       -.Insert(s, index, vals...): Inserts values at a specific index and returns the new slice.
       -.Delete(s, i, j): Removes elements from index i to j-1.
       -.Replace(s, i, j, vals...): Replaces the range [i,j) with new values.
       -.Clip(s): Removes unused capacity from the slice (sets cap to len).
       -.Sort(s): Sorts the slice in place (works on types like integers and strings).
       -.Reverse(s): Reverses the order of elements in the slice in place.
       -.IsSorted(s): Returns true if the slice is already sorted.
17. Map is a built-in data structure that stores data as key-value pairs.
       -len(m),Returns the number of items in the map.
       -delete(m, key),Removes the element with the specified key.
       -clear(m), (Go 1.21+) Removes all elements, leaving an empty map.
18. Range keyword is used to iterate over elements in various data structures.
19. function,
        -(nums...)Variadic Functions! These are functions that can accept any number of arguments of a specific type.
20.closure, is a special type of anonymous function that "closes over" or references variables from outside its own body.
21.Pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another value, rather than the value itself.
22. *name, this return memory location of the value, is mainly used to change the value at the memory location.
22. Struct (short for "structure") is a user-defined type that allows you to group together different fields of different types into a single unit.
23. Interface is a type that specifies a set of method signatures. It is one of the most powerful features of the language, allowing for flexible, modular, and decoupled code.
24. Enum (short for Enumeration) is a distinct type that consists of a set of named constants.
25. Generics allow you to write functions, structures, and methods that work with multiple types while maintaining strict compile-time type safety.
      -any,keyword is simply an alias for the empty interface
      -comparable ,keyword is a built-in interface that represents all types that can be compared using equality operators
26. Goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime.
     -WaitGroup is a synchronization tool in Go (from the sync package) used to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish executing.
     - Defer,is a keyword used to schedule a function call to run immediately before the surrounding function returns.
27. Channels are the pipes that connect concurrent goroutines. They allow you to send values from one goroutine to another,
     ensuring that they synchronize and communicate safely without the need for complex "locks" or shared memory.
     -select statement in Go is like a switch statement, but specifically designed for channels.
     -also we define whether the channel will receive value or send value (<-)
     -channel is made using, nums:= make (chan data type)
28.fmt.Sprintf is a function used to format a string and return it as a value, rather than printing it to the console
29. Mutex (short for Mutual Exclusion) is a synchronization primitive used to prevent multiple goroutines from accessing the same shared resource at the same time.
30. File handling:
      -os,package is your starting point for creating, opening, and deleting files.
      -os.open(file name),Opens an existing file for reading only.
      -.stat(),
      -.Name(),
      -read(),
      -readdir(),
      -Isdir(),
      -Size(),
      -.Flush(),
      -bufio,
      -os.Remove(filename),
